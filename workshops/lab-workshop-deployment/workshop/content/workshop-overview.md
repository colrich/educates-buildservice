This workshop guides you through how to deploy workshops with Educates on Kubernetes and what occurs under the covers when workshops are deployed. The workshop is written to complement the documentation for Educates, acting as a live hands on tutorial which you can use to learn about Educates.

Note that although the workshop environment user does not have any elevated privileges in the Kubernetes cluster, the user can indirectly deploy Educates workshops to the cluster that may grant elevated privileges. Do not therefore run this workshop on a production cluster. If the Kubernetes cluster is not private and local to your own machine, it is recommended that you delete the cluster when you are done with the workshop.

If you do not go through all parts of the workshop, or otherwise cleanup correctly when completing parts of the workshop, workshop deployments may be left behind in the cluster after exiting this workshop. If this occurs, you will need to manually delete those workshop deployments.

To reduce the possibility of loosing access to the workshop environment and thus the ability to run required cleanup steps and extended time duration is set for the workshop. A persistent volume is also allocated for the workshop session so any updates to workshop files are not lost if the workshop session is restarted. If you want to reset the state of the workshop environment you will need to progress right through the workshop, or terminate the workshop session.
