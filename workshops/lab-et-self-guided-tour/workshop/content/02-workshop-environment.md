An Educates workshop environment is accessed through a dashboard in your web browser. This is what you are using now.

By default a user would be presented with a set of workshop instructions on the left, and on the right one or more terminals for interacting with the workshop environment.

What is available through the dashboard is configurable on a per workshop basis. In this workshop for example we have enabled access to a web console for the Kubernetes cluster the workshop environment is running in, an instance of the VS Code editor, as well as embedding access to the Educates documentation.

The additional tabs provided by the dashboard can be for builtin features of Educates, such as the Kubernetes web console and VS Code editor, or you can embed external web sites, such as is being done with the documentation, or web applications which are deployed just for the overall workshop environment or users specific workshop session.

Although primarily intended for hosting workshops, Educates can also be used to provide access to a generic in browser environment which could be used for software development or system administration. In these cases the display of any workshop instructions would be disabled and only the desired applications, such as the terminal, Kubernetes web console and VS Code editor might be visible.
